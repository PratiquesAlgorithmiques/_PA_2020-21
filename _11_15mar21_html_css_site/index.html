            <p>By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present
            lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was
            amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,
            and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own
            marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his
            wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not
            so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent
            of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that
            property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their
            father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the
            remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her
            child, and he had only a life-interest in it.</p>
            
            <p class="premier">The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every
            other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so
            unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew; but
            he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the
            bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife
            and daughters than for himself or his son; but to his son, and his
            son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way,
            as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most
            dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the
            estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up
            for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his
            father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of
            his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children
            of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest
            desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of
            noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for
            years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not
            to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three
            girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.</p>
            
            Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper
            was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many
            years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the
            produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate
            improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was
            his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten
            thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained
            for his widow and daughters.
            
            <p>His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.</p>
            
            Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the
            family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at
            such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make
            them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,
            and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there
            might prudently be in his power to do for them.
            
            [Illustration: _His son's son, a child of four years old._]
            
            He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted
            and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well
            respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of
            his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might
            have been made still more respectable than he was: he might even have
            been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and
            very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature
            of himself; more narrow-minded and selfish.
            
            When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to
            increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand
            pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The
            prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,
            besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his
            heart, and made him feel capable of generosity. "Yes, he would give
            them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would
            be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he
            could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience." He
            thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did
            not repent.
